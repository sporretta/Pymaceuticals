## About

The purpose of this project is to identify the effect a certain drug has on mice compared to other drugs on the market.We want to collect different data to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the drug. We want to clean our data, find summary statistics, and different types of graphs to test our knowledge with the numpy, pyplot, and stats libraries.
